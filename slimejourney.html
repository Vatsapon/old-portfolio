			<p><span class="nA9aFzctAY" style="font-size: 120%">Slime Journey</span> is a 3D puzzle game where you have to give the Slime a command to take him to the goal. The game concept was inspired by the <a class="aA94LKp2AB" href="https://lightbot.com/" target="_blank">LightBot</a> and <a class="aA94LKp2AB" href="https://code.org/" target="_blank">Code.org</a> games. but with additional mechanics.</p>
			<p>The player will be given a few commands that have a different kind of action such as Move forward, Turn left, Wait, etc. to put into the Main Function slot which determines the Slime's action. Then, the player can begin the simulation and see the action as it happens in sequence. Players can retry and reorder the commands to see the different results until the Slime can reach the goal/destination.</p>

				<li>Designed and developed a method that's easy for configuration</li>

			<p>"Mental Challenge" was the theme assigned to this project. This game is one of the puzzle games that come to mind when someone speaks of mental games.</p>
			<p>With that in mind, I created and modified the mechanism to ensure that it worked effectively so as to prepare for future development. Additionally, keep the level and puzzle balanced and challenging to create an "Aha!" moment for those who solve the puzzle.</p>

			<p>Most of the configuration is for personal use only because it's a solo project, so it can become confusing. However, I've modified it to be changeable so that anyone can quickly modify and set up the level in the inspector by simply dragging and dropping elements.</p>
			<p>And with that, finishing everything in a month—design, implementation, and playtesting—becomes a little challenging. However, in the end, it's become a really enjoyable experience that has taught me several things about design and scripting, which I can use to improve and improvise in future projects and further development.</p>
