			<p><span class="nA9aFzctAY" style="font-size: 120%">Grotto</span> is a 3D top-down puzzle game where the player takes on the role of a farmer who needs to find the cure for his wife's illness. He had to enter the dungeon which reside the ancient flower which can cure anything. He needs to use plants and solve the puzzle to proceed further into the deep part of the dungeon to reach the ancient flower.</p>
			<p>The concept of the gameplay mechanic was mainly inspired by <a class="aA94LKp2AB" href="https://moonlighterthegame.com/" target="_blank">Moonlighter</a> and <a class="aA94LKp2AB" href="https://zelda.nintendo.com/" target="_blank">Zelda</a>. The game was mainly focused on puzzle solving with resource management where the player need to use limited resources to solve the puzzles and proceed further along the progression. But similar to the roguelike genre, the player can come back to the farm to gain more plants and upgrade stats and go back to the dungeon to proceed further.</p>

			<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 30px">
				<li>Prototype and Implemented overall gameplay system</li>
				<li>Developing tools for designers to improve work efficiency and project progress</li>
				<li>Collaborating and work closely with programmers, designers, and artists</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Throughout the project, my biggest contribution was creating a tool that helps designers work more efficiently and progress their projects while also assisting in resolving technical problems that other team members may have experienced.</p>
			<p>When I created a tool for designers, I saw it as a challenge that would help me advance my knowledge and advance additional skills. The tool that I exclusively worked for this project is the 3D Tilemap Editor.</p>

			<p class="nA9aFzctAY ga9FA0GI3a">My Tool Creation - 3D Tilemap Editor</p>
			<p>Since the engine does not support making 3D tilemaps, I took up the challenge to make one. I was able to pick up new skills and help designers create polished or white-box levels for the project. Understanding designers' viewpoints, their needs for the tool, and how it will help them was the primary step toward progress. I then went ahead and learned how to create a tool that would work for them using the engine's editor. In the end, my first attempt at making a tool worked out well, offering a variety of features and systems with a user-friendly interface.</p>
			<p>In order to ensure smooth development and fewer issues, I also picked up project organizing skills from my team and from my prior experience during this project. Ultimately, it was a challenging and great opportunity for me to learn unfamiliar skills, accomplish my objectives, and work with my team.</p>
			<p>Despite the fact that the game isn't completed because of unexpected circumstances that occurred during the process, it's still a fun experience where I discovered new things and encountered things I hadn't experienced before.</p>
