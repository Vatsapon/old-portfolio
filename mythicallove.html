			<p><span class="nA9aFzctAY" style="font-size: 120%">Mythical Love</span> is a 2D dating simulation game where you have to find your suitable partner during school time. You can choose where to go and who to talk with along the story until they reach the ending.</p>
			<p>Similar to many dating simulation games, each choice the player chooses, will affect the progress and how the player ends up with different endings. The player must find the best way and choice to appeal to your relationship to reach a happy ending, or else you will end up getting rejected.</p>
			<p>There'll also be some gimmick mechanics for player to interact with such as choosing your food course during lunch time and decorating your room for your appeal as a fun little game for the player to play during the game progress.</p>

			<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 30px">
				<li>Assisted UI design and implemented the whole game UI systems</li>
				<li>Collaborated with Programmer and Artist to help with implementation and organization</li>
				<li>Implemented and fixed various bugs related to UI and other systems</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I joined this project in the middle of development. Working on a new game genre, like a dating simulation game that I haven't tried before, is a truly enjoyable task. and implementing certain new systems, such as the loading screen, gallery system, etc. I find it difficult to balance work and school at the same time. However, it worked out in the end and became one of my most proud projects to which I have contributed after numerous attempts and trial and error.</p>

			<p class="nA9aFzctAY ga9FA0GI3a">Gallery and Database System</p>
			<p>Most of dating simulation games provide a gallery collectible that shows off all of the achievements or photo collections acquired during game play. It took me a while to figure out the algorithms and workarounds for this in order to create a system that could manage various gallery collection types.</p>
			<p>Characters, locations, CGs (moment image), sketches (bonus / hidden image behind the scenes), and music are all included in this particular case. To improve work efficiency and avoid creating objects one at a time, I came to the decision to create a system that would automatically implement the visual slot with functionality.</p>
			<p>Working on this project has been both enjoyable and challenging, and I have learned new techniques for implementing UI that I would not have otherwise given consideration to. It turned out to be one of the most successful ones I have ever worked on as well.</p>
