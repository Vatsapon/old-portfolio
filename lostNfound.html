			<p><span class="nA9aFzctAY" style="font-size: 120%">Lost & Found Co.</span> is a 2D hidden object with a narrative game. The player played as Ducky, the first employee of a startup company founded by Mei, a long-forgotten goddess.  The player must help Ducky find lost items in certain areas.</p>
			<p>The concept of the game is based on a classic hidden game where the player needs to find objects on the screen. Except that this game has a light-hearted narrative and art style with unique gameplay that has more interaction with the game.</p>

			<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 30px">
				<li>Research and Approach with efficient methods to enhance the gameplay system</li>
				<li>Wireframing and Design programming structures for solid and flexible systems</li>
				<li>Collaborate with designers and other programmers closely to increase work efficiency</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="nA9aFzctAY ga9FA0GI3a" style="margin-top: 30px">Internal Work - Level Editor Tool</h2>
			<p>My primary focus is on Level Editor, a tool that allows designers to create highly adjustable levels for game play. Other programmers had previously implemented the system. Thus, in order to work on it, I must comprehend the current structure.</p>
			<p>Before I could make modifications to the system on my own without assistance, I had to read and attempt to fully understand the system's structure for a while.</p>
			<p>Compared to my previous projects, this one has a more complicated programming structure. Furthermore, every aspect of the structure has a purpose and makes logical sense, which helps lessen struggle and increase adaptability.</p>
			<p>In regard to this, I have discovered that learning programming structure involves more than merely writing at whim using your experience. There are times when working on a larger structure must be planned before you begin writing. Here, the process includes brainstorming, planning, prototyping, and testing. Even though it took plenty of time to complete, it was still worthwhile to work on in the future.</p>
			<h2 class="nA9aFzctAY ga9FA0GI3a" style="margin-top: 30px">External Work - Porting from PC to Mobile</h2>
			<p>In addition to working on this project, which is internal, I had the opportunity to work on an external project that involved porting. One of my responsibilities is to migrate the input control system from the PC (Keyboard & Mouse) to the mobile device (Touch screen / Game Controller). This is a crucial task that must be completed in order to switch to a new input system.</p>
			<p>Gesture or Conditional Input, including Double-Tap, Drag, and Swipe, is one of the most challenging aspects of creating touch screen controls. Thus, I made use of the Unity package's On-Screen Button system, which could only handle one action or input path at a time. However, because to the button mapping design's requirement for various actions with only one button such as Double-Tap for Rolling and Tap for Jumping.</p>
			<p>I made the decision to look into and tweak the script on my own in order to create a new On-Screen Button system that allows for multiple actions/input paths. The button's input path, which simulates an input key, is how it performs. Additionally, data will be sent to the Event System as a triggering input key when the button is pressed. I made the decision to manually send data by adding an additional path when executing an event. When the condition is met, I can afterwards create a tap system that handles tap events and sends data.</p>
			<h2 class="nA9aFzctAY ga9FA0GI3a" style="margin-top: 30px">Experience & Lesson from Work</h2>
			<p>Working on professional projects taught me that there is no such thing as a flawless solution when it comes to programming or design. Depending on how close we are to finding the perfect answer, that is. Additionally, in order to collaborate with lots of unfamiliar coworkers, people need to adjust to live with one another.</p>
			<p>In summary, it is among the best job opportunities I have ever had because it allowed me to learn about new fields of expertise that I had never encountered in a professional environment. It demonstrates that I have a lot of interesting material to learn and can access new types of knowledge that will advance my skill set.</p>
